## What is a "Diplomarbeit"?
It is basically a highschool thesis.

What is my thesis about?
We develop a chess game in Java.
The GUI is the JavaFX GUI and we create an AI (Artificial Intelligence).
Further we develop the game to be played on a Raspberry Pi or Android Device.

Further information can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/alexl4123/diplomarbeit/wiki)

Who is in the team?
Myself (Alexander Beiser) and a colleague of mine.

## coding style?


We donÂ´t have a public "coding style policy" and
trust you! - at least until now
The only thing that would make the team happy is:
COMMENTS - EVERYWHERE,
so other people know what you have done

## We just have added a small Wiki page, for further technical introduction


## Code is uploaded - have fun ;)
