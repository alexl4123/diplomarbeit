## What is a "Diplomarbeit"?
It is basically a highschool thesis.

What is my thesis about?
We develop a chess game in Java.
The GUI is the JavaFX GUI and we create an AI.
Further we develop the game to be played on a Raspberry Pi or Android Device.

Who is in the team?
Myself (Alexander Beiser) and a college of mine.

## coding style?


We donÂ´t have a public "coding style policy" and
trust you! - at least until now
The only thing that would make the team happy is:
COMMENTS - EVERYWHERE,
so other people know what you have done

## We just have added a small Wiki page, for further technical introduction


## Code is uploaded - but a strange version - will be fixed soon - have fun ;)
